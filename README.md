This is the code and data that were initially created for use during the practical exercises of the Coral Bleaching Monitoring training webinar series on 12-14 November 2024. 

The code and data can be downloaded and uploaded to the [DUNIA sandbox](https://dunia.esa.int/sandbox) platform for further use. 

You would still need to download a daily [OSTIA Sea Surface Temperature](https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00165) subset for the Red Sea region from [Copernicus Marine Services](https://marine.copernicus.eu/) for this code to run without errors. The period used in our examples is 2023-01-01 to 2024-09-01 and the region used is 12-23 degrees North and 32-44 degrees East.
